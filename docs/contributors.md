# Contributors

## Be careful

Do not commit any credentials

## Code Quality

This project uses [Python Code Quality and Lint](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/python-code-quality-and-lint), you need to ensure that everything will go to PR be accepted.

## Tests

New features need to be tested to maintain test coverage (which is currently very poor)

## New ideas

I intend to accept any idea that is thought of for a standard game DataBase. The limitations are to have a good usability and financial.
